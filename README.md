# Arabic-Poetry-Word-Embedding
Word Embedding for Arabic Poetry using Word2Vec

## Building Word2Vec model:
### * Firstly, you need to install the following packages:
####1- "pip install gensim"
####2- "pip install pandas"
####3- "pip install pyarabic"

### * Run in cmd "python build_model.py"
This should take from 15 min to 30 min depending on your PC


## Testing the model:
### * open "test_model.py" file.
for best experience try working with jupyter or python interactive so that you don't load the whole model every time you test.

### * change the words

### * Run in cmd "python test_model.py"


## Visualizing the model:
### * You need to install the following packages:
####1- "pip install sklearn"
####2- "pip install python-bidi"
####3- "pip install arabic_reshaper"
####4- "pip install matplotlib"

### * Run in cmd "python load_and_visualize_model.py" 
This will visualize the first 100 words

#### I recommend you to visualize the model with work of MR. Amr Salama in here
